**[SIV] Simple Item View**

[----Purpose----]

This mod adds a way to view some information and stats of a weapon while also categorizing it. This can help you better understand what weapons are on the ground in-front of you.

[----Reason----]

More practice with gLua, again, and to create some visual enhancing elements for physical objects in servers.

[---Misc.---]

Note: If there are any bugs/issue please let me know.
